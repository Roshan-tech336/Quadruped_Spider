# Quadruped Spider: The Surveillance Robot
Welcome to our project build for Smart Bengal Hackathon 2K24! Our quadruped spider surveillance robot, controlled by a Raspberry Pi Zero W and Arduino Uno, offers a unique blend of agility and surveillance capabilities. With its four legs and array of sensors, including cameras and microphones, the robot is designed for tasks such as home security, outdoor exploration, and educational demonstrations.

# Features
Agile Movement: The spider-like design allows for smooth and agile movement, making it ideal for navigating various terrains.
Surveillance Capabilities: Equipped with cameras and microphones, the robot can monitor its surroundings and transmit live video and audio feed.
Remote Control: Control the robot remotely using a web interface, accessing live video feed and controlling its movements.
Educational Tool: The project serves as an educational tool for learning about robotics, programming, and electronics.
